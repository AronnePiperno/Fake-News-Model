**Fake News Detection Models**

This project focuses on detecting fake news within articles using a variety of supervised machine learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Transformers.

The project explors the effectiveness of different models across diverse datasets: Kaggle, WELFake and Liar.
